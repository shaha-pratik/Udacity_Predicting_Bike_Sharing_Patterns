# Udacity_Predicting_Bike_Sharing_Patterns
This project is a part of deep learning nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). By building a neural network from the scratch we will be implementating basic of neural network.

## Project Instruction

1. Clone the repository

```
https://github.com/shaha-pratik/Udacity_Predicting_Bike_Sharing_Patterns.git
```
2. Install Anaconda or miniconda

This step is not mandatory but it will really good to understand and manage the environment in conda. Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers at https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

After that you can open the anaconda prompt and create the virtual environment name `bike_sharing_pattern` and activate as follow:

```
conda create --name bike_sharing_pattern python=3.6
conda activate bike_sharing_pattern
```

For conda cheat-sheet can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)

3. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html) as below

* Linux or Mac:
```
pip3 install torch===1.3.1 torchvision===0.4.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

4. After that to install [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). The jupyter notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document.
Also Install other dependencies like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
```
conda install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
```

5. Go to terminal and type
```
jupyter Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb
```
